    <h2>Rex Orange County</h2>
    <p>Alexander James O'Connor (born 4 May 1998), known professionally as Rex Orange County, is a British singer,
        songwriter and multi-instrumentalist from Grayshott, England. NPR Music's ZoÃ« Jones has described O'Connor's
        music as "a bright blend of hip-hop, jazz, and bedroom pop".[6]
        Teaching himself how to produce his own music at the age of 16, he released his debut album, Bcos U Will Never B
        Free (2015), on Bandcamp and SoundCloud. O'Connor then released numerous solo singles throughout 2016 and 2017,
        including the Platinum-certified singles, "Sunflower" and "Best Friend", and then released his second album,
        Apricot Princess (2017). Tyler, the Creator collaborated with O'Connor on two songs from Tyler's fourth album,
        Flower Boy (2017), which caused O'Connor to rise in prominence, allowing him to sign with RCA Records.
        O'Connor released his third album, Pony (2019), lyrically exploring more personal topics and experimenting with
        different genres. The album became his first to enter the Billboard 200 in the United States, peaking at number
        3 on the chart. His fourth studio album, Who Cares? (2022), topped the UK Albums Chart and peaked at number 5 on
        the Billboard 200. He released his fifth album, The Alexander Technique, in late 2024.</p>

        Bandcamp and SoundCloud. The project caught the attention of producer Two Inch Punch, leading to collaborations
        including the single Uno (2016).</p>
    <h3>2017-2018: Meningkat ke Panggung Besar & Apricot Princess</h3>
    <p>The debut album drew the attention of Tyler, the Creator, who invited him to Los Angeles to contribute to Flower

        made with Benny Sings, expanded his reach. In 2018, he performed on The Tonight Show and released a cover of
        Youve Got a Friend in Me with Randy Newman.</p>

        album Who Cares? came out in March 2022, topping the UK Albums Chart. He later released the single Threat (2022)

    </p>

    <h1>Personal Life</h1>
    <p>In 2015, O'Connor began dating fellow British singer-songwriter Thea Morgan-Murrell (known professionally as
        Thea), having met while attending the BRIT School together.[33] He sang about her in several of his songs, and
        they collaborated on the tracks "Sycamore Girl" and "Never Had the Balls".[34][35] On 24 November 2020, he
        confirmed on Twitter that they were separated, tweeting "i am not in a relationship".[36]

        On 10 October 2022, O'Connor appeared in Southwark Crown Court and was charged with six counts of sexual assault
        of the same woman, alleged to have taken place in June 2021. He pleaded not guilty to all counts and was bailed,
        with a trial provisionally scheduled for 3 January 2023. A representative for O'Connor released a statement on
        his behalf which read: "Alex is shocked by the allegations, which he denies, and looks forward to clearing his
        name in court. He is unable to make any further comment because of the ongoing proceedings".[37] On 22 December
        2022, O'Connor released a statement saying all charges against him were dropped and the case was to be dismissed
        following an investigation by the Crown Prosecution Service. O'Connor claimed in his statement that CCTV footage
        and a police interview with the complainant's partner - who was with her on the night in question - did not
        match her account, meaning the case did not meet the CPS's legal test for a prosecution.[38]</p>
